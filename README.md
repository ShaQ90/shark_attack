###### The team:

:memo: Johana , Tiago, Konstantin, Jean Pilippe :memo: 


### First Porject whit Data Analytics  
Day one:

- [x] Define a Road Map
- [x] Learn about business problem and MVP(minimum viable product)
- [x] Observe the data we have at hands


Day two:

- [x] Learn what is the library Regex
- [x] Learn how to manage dates
- [x] Clean the database

Day three:

- [x] Structure the data to start reading it 
- [x] Learn EDA and how to implement it
- [x] Start to link the hypotheses to the data 

Day four:

- [x] Finish the cleaning and structure of the data
- [x] Brainstorm about the data we collected
- [x] Finish the presentation
- [x] Make the READ.ME File



### :bulb: The IDEA :bulb: 

The data we recieved was about :shark: Attacks on the globe, so we decided to use it to advise and help people to avoid the attacks, doing it by creating an app that provides real-time alerts to users about nearby shark sightings, using advanced data analytics to identify predictive patterns, geographic hotspots, and seasonal trends, while offering an intuitive interface and educational resources to enhance safety and awareness for marine sport enthusiasts, researchers, and local authorities.



### :brain: Our hypothesis and MVP :brain: 

#### Predictive Patterns in Historical Data - Time tables and activities :heavy_check_mark: 
Data type : Categorical
Visualization:  bar charts to compare the frequency of attacks across different activities. Identify which are most associated with attacks. This information can inform targeted warnings for specific activities.
Relationship between variables: 
 Activity vs. Time of Day: You can analyze if certain activities are more dangerous during specific times of the day (e.g., are surfers at greater risk in the early morning?).
 
 
#### Geographic Hotspots - Countries - State - Location :heavy_check_mark: 
Data type: categorical
Visualization:  box plot to visualize the distribution of attacks across different geographic locations, by cuntries 
Relationship between variables: 
Location vs. Outcome (Fatal/Survived): Analyze if some locations are associated with more severe outcomes.

#### Seasonal Influence - Date - separate in seasons - add a column Seasons :no_good: 
Data type: categorical
Visualization: seasonal bar chart to show how the frequency of attacks varies by season. This helps understanding seasonal trends and preparing for peak risk periods. 
Relationship between variables: 
Activity vs. Season: Combine this with seasonal data to see if the risk of certain activities increases during specific seasons (e.g., is swimming riskier in the summer?).



### :coffee: How it went :coffee:

After some liters of coffee, we built the road map and divided ourselves in 2 teams for the first 3 days. With many questions and a lot of willpower we dived into the deep sea tha is Data Analytics. As a group, we think this project was huge and that we didn't have enough time to finish it as we wanted. Some functions were not achieved because of a lack of understanding of the problem and the new tools.
